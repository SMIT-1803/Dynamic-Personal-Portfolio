         and experience in a clean and engaging way. Using React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and Locomotive Scroll, I 
         crafted a smooth-scrolling, animation-rich website that reflects both technical ability and design intuition. The 
         site features modular project components, an animated hamburger menu, and responsive layoutsâ€”optimized for performance 
         across all devices. Feel free to explore the live site or check out the GitHub repo via the icons above for the source
